strives for worry-free experiences and full embracement of the individual's potential.<br>
  “Just take a deep breath…” is a message that appropriately suits the values of our brand as it creates a personal connection with the customer, who experiences difficulties in relieving their anxiety. It invites them to find their way to achieving EMOTIONAL BALANCE AND MINDFULNESS, and therefore – PEACE AND COMFORT while expressing themselves. The message also creates a connection between the product and the values, as in order to be effective -  the user has to smell it. The promotional activities are entirely executed in Instagram, as it tends to be a vastly developing social media platform for supporting small businesses. Our posts convey the brand values and reveals the products and core ingredients. 
	    We have two reels and several posts, as well as shared many stories that tried to involve the audience by answering polls and reply on our stories. <br>
<br>
1)	REACH OBJECTIVE: We are striving for a reach of 500 Instagram users by the 10th April. – Since we are a new brand, accumulating audience for the short period of time we have would be our main priority.
	    
	    
	    <br>
<br>
2)	AFFECT OBJECTIVE: Our brand is all about confidence and reducing anxiety levels when having to experience something new. Therefore, core priority for our brand is to create trust in our products and mission. We want them to refer to us as the “number one” brand that helps and will help in their journey to exploring their full potential while reducing anxiety levels. They should feel understood, safe, more confident and invincible in the face of any difficulties, so that we can measure our mission as accomplished.
	    
	    <br>
<br>
3)	RESPONSE OBJECTIVE: In order to raise awareness for our brand, we will need the Instagram users to be as active as possible and responsive to our publications. This means – liking, sharing posts and leaving comments below our posts. For instance – whenever we post a reel, we want them to share it or tag friends that can relate to the given content. Another alternative would be sharing positive feedback about our products on their Instagram stories or posts. As for now, in order to measure that the reach is growing, a sign would be if we see the following things:<br>
 
	    
	   <br>
 •	50 clicks on the website link
<br>
	    •	10 comments under the posts overall 
<br>
	    •	10 likes on each post ( at least) <br>
<br>

	    
	    
	    •	FUTURE PLANNING<br>

	    
	    After getting some experience in brand promotion, we came up with a few points for future planning.
	    In order to gain more followers and increase brand awareness, more reels should be created. This is a useful tool as it reaches more people on Instagram. Moreover, today TikTok is gaining popularity and brands are actively using this platform. We would recommend creating a Flaunta account on this social media and start creating content. Another important part is that the content should be original, but also follow current trends. That way, more people will visit the website and Instagram account.
	    To continue the brand development, it would be useful to create a community where people can support each other in terms of dealing with stress and anxiety. Our brand can connect people. That way we will be associated as not just a perfume brand, but something that brings people together. That can be done by loyalty memberships and closed communities for our regular customers.
	    After gaining more target audience and increasing profit, we could send free samples so the future customers can give them a try to perfume. Possibly, we could collaborate with fashion and beauty magazines. Or local stores.
	    As the brand’s values are emotional balance, peace and comfort, we still have to focus on making people comfortable in their own skin. Therefore, we always have to consider customers’ needs. We especially have to listen to any feedback and always improve the service and the product.<br>
<br>

	    •	LEARNING POINTS<br>

	    
	    During the campaign we learnt some useful information about content planning and how social media works. 
	    First of all, we set a pretty low number (50) of reaches for the reach objective. In fact, we have noticed that reels can bring a lot of people to our account compering to posts and stories. Our account reached 5,631 reaches through reels. Considering that, next time we will put more reels to our content calendar. 
	    We also believe that specific time of posting helped us to reach more accounts. We expected to reach out as many accounts as possible considering the number of our followers. For example, we did not post on Sundays as it is considered to be the worst day to post on Instagram. 
	    The same thing happened to response objective- we received way more likes and comments than expected. We could set bigger goals at the very start.
	    We learned that that we need at least 100 followers in order to learn more about people who are following us (now we have 74). It would be useful to analyze our audience in order to see in which direction to move. We could see if there are more male or female followers (our brand is unisex). 
	    What we could have done differently is try to create more interaction with the followers. We could use more polls, questions and voting on Instagram stories. That way, we could arise the interest and involvement.  That could contribute to one of our ways of achievements ‘Increase brand-awareness and trust to the brand. 
	    Moreover, we could not create ‘a community who are ready to support each other in getting confidence with the help of our brand’ as it requires more time than expected. We also need more loyal audience. 
	    Overall, we did learn a lot while this promotion campaign. We definitely need to learn more social media tricks in order to reach and engage more people. We do consider our campaign successful as we have reached our reach and response objectives. We managed to get numbers way bigger than the set ones. </h5>
